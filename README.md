What do I do?

This scrapes Amazon recent reviews for specified products on and stores them in a Postgres DB

How do you use me?

Input an ASIN and the corresponding Amazon listing will be scraped and its Review Data added to Postgres DB


How do you contribute to me?

In this project I am learning and practicing a number of skills, if you would like to comment on my code in places I could write better code, it would be much appreciated.
